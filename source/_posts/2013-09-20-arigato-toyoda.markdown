In case you missed it, Eiji Toyoda [passed away](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/18/business/global/eiji-toyoda-promoter-of-toyota-way-dies-at-100.html?smid=tw-share&_r=2&) recently. Not only the architect of "lean manufacturing" and [The Toyota Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Toyota_Way), his impact lives in the DevOps community.

[Gene Kim] explains [The Three Ways](http://itrevolution.com/the-three-ways-principles-underpinning-devops/) better than I can, but in short:

1. Systems Thinking - Don't think about the parts of the system, think of the entire pipeline. If **only** dev or **only** ops completes their job, there's still no useful product.
2. Amplify Feedback Loops - Improving communication and learning what to fix
3. Culture of Continual Experimentation and Learning - Applying what you learned in the Second Way

Compare this to the main four sections of The Toyota Way:

1. Long-term philosophy
2. The right process will produce the right results
3. Add value to the organization by developing your people
4. Continuously solving root problems drives organizational learning.

This doesn't seem to map perfect, until you realize that working through sections meant:

- "Long term philosophy" turns out to mean the same thing as "Systems Thinking" once you actually understand the system.
- Developing and respect people is central to amplifying feedback looks -- if you're not listening (and this means REALLY listening) to your customers, providers, or neighbors, you can't improve on their complaints.
- Kaizen is pretty much the exact definition of the willingness to continue to experiment and grow to improve the system and flow.
